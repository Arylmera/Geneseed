# Geneseed — Design

The spec behind the harness. Read this before changing structure.

## Origin

Geneseed is a generic port of a personal, Obsidian-vault-grown agent system. The
source system had five layers: governance law, folder-owning delegate agents,
lifecycle-hook automation, skills, and persistent memory. Geneseed keeps the
parts that are **runtime-agnostic** and drops the parts that assumed a specific
vault or a specific tool's hooks.

## Decisions

1. **Target: generic `AGENT.md`, no hooks assumed.** The harness must work in any
   assistant that reads an instructions file at the repo root. Automation is
   therefore *optional* (standalone CLIs) rather than load-bearing.

2. **Instructions-first.** The valuable behaviours (memory, learning, delegation)
   are expressed primarily as instructions in `AGENT.md` that the model follows.
   Scripts are a power-user convenience layered on top, never a requirement.

3. **Theme is voice; structure is theme-independent.** A single neutral source
   renders to any theme via token substitution, split into two classes:
   - **Structure** (always plain English, every theme, every emit) — the section
     names and structural nouns (Rules, Agents, Skills, Memory, Workspace, Context,
     Scripts) and the folder names (`laws/`, `agents/`, `skills/`, `memory/`). These
     live in the `STRUCTURE` map in `build.py` and are laid on top of every render,
     so a theme can never change a name, a heading, or a path. Documents and their
     scaffolding stay consistent and tool-friendly.
   - **Voice** (themed) — how the AI *responds* (`VOICE` directive) and how the prose
     *inside* the docs is written: `TAGLINE`, `LOADED_SIGIL`, `EPI_*`, `BENEDICTION`,
     `DESC_*`, `ROAST_PERSONA`. Theme files carry voice tokens only.

   So `imperial` flavours the words and the agent's tone (the readiness sigil, the
   epigraphs, the descriptions) while every section is still `## Agents`, every
   folder still `agents/`, and links resolve identically across themes. The source
   tree under `src/` stays neutral for sane authoring. Toggle = one flag.

   The OpenCode emits add only: native skills at `skills/<name>/SKILL.md` (not slash
   commands) and an `AGENT.md` skill-link rewrite to that nested path.

4. **Delegation by capability, not by folder.** The source system owned content
   folders with delegate agents. For code repositories, specialists by capability
   (reviewer, tester, architect, docs, security) fit better and stay generic.

5. **Hermetic — with one git-ignored escape hatch.** The *tracked* harness
   references nothing outside itself — no links into the vault it grew from, no
   secrets, no host-specific paths. This guarantees a clean `git subtree split` /
   copy into any destination. The single sanctioned bridge to host-specific
   documentation is the `context.json` manifest (Decision 6): it is git-ignored, so
   host paths and proprietary docs never enter the published bundle, so
   hermeticity holds.

6. **Project context is a single git-ignored manifest — never published.** A
   consumer often needs the agent to know about substantial external documentation
   (framework internals, front-/back-end architecture) that must not be committed
   into the portable harness. A `context.json` file at the bundle root lists those
   docs by path, each with a `load` mode (`eager` = read every session, `lazy` =
   read on demand). The build writes an empty `context.json` once and never
   overwrites it; that file and the docs it points at stay on the machine. The agent
   reads it dynamically — no build step, tool-agnostic — and it is distinct from
   `memory/` (atomic learned *facts*) by holding pointers to *bodies of
   documentation* maintained elsewhere. It also subsumes what a baked-in project
   rules file used to do: point at the project's own conventions instead.

## Components

The `Harness/` output column shows the **neutral** folder name; the imperial theme
renders it as the name in parentheses.

| Component | Source | `Harness/` output | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Entrypoint | `src/AGENT.md.tmpl` | `AGENT.md` | what the tool reads; inlines the rules, links the rest |
| Governance | `src/laws/` | `laws/` (`leges/`) | universal rules |
| Delegation | `src/agents/` | `agents/` (`legati/`) | capability specialists with output contracts |
| Workflows | `src/skills/` | `skills/` (`rites/`) | repeatable procedures |
| Memory | `src/memory/` | `memory/` (`anamnesis/`) | one-fact-per-file convention + index |
| Context | `build.py` | `context.json` | empty per-repo manifest, written once and never overwritten; git-ignore it |
| Themes | `themes/*.json` | — | token → label maps |
| Generator | `build.py` | — | substitution + `<!-- INCLUDE: -->` inlining |
| Automation | `rituals/harness.py` | — | optional `build` / `doctor` / `learn` |
| Adapters | `adapters/` | — | optional per-tool glue (hooks) |

## Generator contract

- Substitutes `{{TOKEN}}` in file *contents* only; paths are never themed.
- Resolves `<!-- INCLUDE: relpath -->` by inlining the rendered target.
- Unknown tokens are left visible (debugging aid); `doctor` flags them.
- Stdlib only; no third-party dependencies, ever.

## Explicitly out of scope

Graph/index generation, web-clipping pipelines, session-classification capture,
sync-conflict cleanup, and folder-ownership delegation — all assumed a specific
vault and lifecycle hooks. They are not ported. The `learn` CLI is the one
distilled survivor of the original learning loop, made model-CLI-agnostic.
