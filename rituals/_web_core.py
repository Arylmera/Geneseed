# ---- Docs registry ---------------------------------------------------------
# The Docs menu is one rail entry on the web UI ("Harness → Docs") that surfaces
# the on-disk documentation through a left sub-nav. Each entry below becomes
# one page in that sub-nav. `kind` decides how the page is rendered:
#
#   markdown — read `source` (relative to ROOT) and render it. Optional keys:
#              `anchor` scrolls the rendered page to a heading; `slice: True`
#              trims the body to just that anchor's section (heading line
#              through the line before the next heading of equal-or-greater
#              depth, code fences respected) so one source file can power
#              many focused panel pages without duplicating prose.
#   concept  — inline curated blurb; `body` is the markdown. Usually ends with
#              a `link` into the existing Library route.
#   cli      — generated CLI reference (introspects harness.build_argparser()).
#   glossary — theme-aware glossary; reads the deployed theme's JSON tokens.
#   about    — install snapshot (version, license, repo). Generated.
#
# The IA is organised around reader intent — Get started · Core concepts ·
# How-to · Reference · Deeper — not around source files. README.md and
# SETUP.md stay canonical for GitHub readers; the web panel slices them.
#
# Docs pages render explanation files, never `docs/specs/*` — specs are design
# history, not user-facing docs, and get renamed or removed. A page that needs
# prose gets its own doc file (e.g. docs/wiki.md) or a slice of a canonical one.

         "Rules apply: every Rule is always in force.\n\n"
         "### The difference\n\n"
         "- **Full** — Section 1 of `AGENT.md` inlines every Rule's complete text "
         "*and* its reasoning. The agent sees the full law set, rationale included, "
         "on every single turn.\n"
         "- **Lean** — Section 1 carries each Rule as its **heading + the rule "
         "itself** (one line), followed by a pointer to the complete law file. The "
         "full text of every Rule still ships beside `AGENT.md` (in `laws/"
         "universal.md`) — the agent reads it on demand when a rule's application is "
         "unclear. Lean trims Section 1 by roughly 40%.\n\n"
         "### Why it exists\n\n"
         "Context is scarce and metered (Rule XV). The law set is the single largest "
         "always-loaded block in the harness. Full keeps every word of guidance in "
         "front of the agent at all times; lean reclaims that budget — and the tokens "
         "you pay for it — for the actual task, keeping the rules themselves present "
         "but moving their elaboration one read away.\n\n"
         "### Pros & cons\n\n"
         "**Full** — *pro:* maximum guidance density; the rationale behind every Rule "
         "is always in context with zero indirection, which a smaller model leans on. "
         "*con:* the largest per-turn token cost; more of the window spent on laws.\n\n"
         "**Lean** — *pro:* ~40% smaller instruction block, so lower token cost every "
         "turn and more room for the task — valuable on long sessions, large repos, "
         "or cost-sensitive runs. *con:* the reasoning isn't eagerly in context; for a "
         "nuanced edge case the agent must read the full law file (one extra fetch), "
         "and a weaker model may apply a rule less precisely without its rationale in "
         "front of it.\n\n"
         "Lean is **safe**: it still ships the complete law text and explicitly points "
         "the agent there before acting on secrets, deletion, git history, scope, or "
         "untrusted content. It's an optimization, not a rules cut.\n\n"
         "### Same harness, either way\n\n"
         "Footprint changes neither what the harness *is* nor what it can *do*. Across "
         "lean and full the emitted files are identical — same Agents, Skills, plugins, "
         "commands, Memory, Notebook, and host hooks — and every Rule is present and "
         "binding. The only structural change is that a **lean** install on a global, "
         "Claude, or Bob target also ships the standalone `laws/universal.md` (the "
         "on-demand fallback); project bundles already carry it. The only behavioural "
         "change is that each Rule's *reasoning* loads on demand instead of every turn.\n\n"
         "That one difference still has a real edge: with the rationale always in front "
         "of it, a model applies a Rule's nuance more reliably than when it must fetch "
         "the full text first — most visible on subtle edge cases, or with a smaller / "
         "cheaper model that may not reach for the pointer. A capable model that reads "
         "the law when a rule's application is unclear behaves equivalently. This is why "
         "**full is the default** and lean is the opt-in.\n\n"
         "### Which to choose\n\n"
         "- Keep **full** if token cost is a non-issue, you want the rationale always "
         "present, or you run a smaller/cheaper model.\n"
         "- Switch to **lean** to economize context and cost, trusting the agent to "
         "pull the full law when it needs the *why*.\n\n"
         "### How to set it\n\n"
         "It's set-and-forget — stored in the `.geneseed-footprint` marker and "
         "preserved across every rebuild. Changing it re-emits the install.\n\n"
         "- **Settings** — the **Footprint** toggle flips the current install "
         "(full ⇄ lean) and rebuilds it in place.\n"
         "- **Harnesses tab** — a per-harness dropdown sets it for any one install "
         "independently, then **Apply**.\n"
         "- **Setup / re-theme wizard** (TUI) — asks for footprint alongside voice "
         "and mode.\n"
         "- **CLI** — `build.py --footprint lean` (with any `--emit`).\n\n"
