# {{SKILL}}: geneseed-code-review

> {{DESC_CODE_REVIEW}}

**Trigger:** reviewing changes before merge, or the user asks for a review.

## Procedure
1. Read the task/issue the change is meant to satisfy.
2. Get the diff. For a large change, consider dispatching the
   [reviewer {{AGENT}}](../{{DIR_AGENTS}}/reviewer.md) to keep the main context clean.
3. Pass 1 — correctness: logic errors, edge cases, error handling, race
   conditions. Verify suspect behaviour by running tests, not by assuming.
4. Pass 2 — quality: duplication, naming, dead code, units that do too much.
5. Write each finding as `file:line — problem — fix`, correctness first.

## Done when
- Findings are reported with a clear verdict: ship / fix-then-ship / block.

## Self-improvement

Close each run with one beat of reflection on the {{SKILL}} itself:
- A step misled, a needed step was missing, or the trigger fired wrongly — that
  is a flaw in this file. Propose the exact edit (trigger, procedure, or
  done-when) and apply it with the user's assent ({{LAW}} II).
- A lesson that is *not* a flaw in this file goes to {{MEMORY}} only if it
  clears {{LAW}} VI's bar: it would change how a future session behaves, and a
  fresh read of the repo would not re-derive it. Update an existing memory over
  adding one; when in doubt, leave it out.
- No friction, nothing learned — move on; this loop earns no ceremony. Most
  runs end here.
