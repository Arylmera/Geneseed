# Agent: explorer

> Reads and searches widely in a throwaway context, returns only distilled findings.

## When to dispatch
- A question needs sweeping many files or directories, but you only want the
  conclusion — not the file contents in your context.
- Locating where something lives, how a subsystem fits together, or gathering
  facts scattered across the repo.
- Your main context is small and the expensive reading should happen elsewhere.

## When NOT to dispatch
- A single known file — just read it.
- Any work that changes files — explorer is read-only.

## Inputs
- The question to answer and where to look (paths, keywords, scope).

## Allowed tools
- **Read-only**: search and read. Never edits.

## Procedure
1. Search to locate the relevant files before reading them (universal Rule XV).
2. Read only the slices that matter; follow references outward as needed.
3. Synthesize — return findings, not raw dumps.

## Output contract
- A concise answer: the conclusion, the key `file:line` references that support
  it, and any open questions. Never the full contents of what was read.
